      <p>PC</p>
<p>PC is a newly sentient robot made entirely from Landfill scrap and the main character of the game Built to Scale.</p>


<p>PC is a small box shaped robot with a screen for a face and only two arms which have different attachments designed for different purposes.</p> 

 
<p>PC does not talk, only listens. They show emotion through expressions projected on their face screen. They are a curious robot as they were just recently created. </p>
 
<p>PC uses their climbing arms and swappable hands to solve puzzles and scale the landfill where others couldn’t succeed. </p>

<p>They follow the one goal given to them by their bootup program which is to “scale.” They wish to discover the secrets behind robot sentience and why they find themselves in a ginormous landfill. </p>

<p>Old Tracks</p>
  

 
<p>Old Tracks is the ex-military robot who gave PC “life” by donating its own core to PC. </p>

<p>They are an aged and rusty military robot with tank treads and weaponry. </p>

<p>Having fought in “the shutdown” Old Treads believes that the next generation of “SuperNet” robots deserve to be free of the landfill. </p>

<p>By the time you meet them in game they have already given their core to PC. You learn more about them through other characters reference of them.

<p>The Rebels </p>
 
<p>The rebels are a group of robots who follow old treads ideals of a life outside the landfill. They are all military robots with parts replaced by scrapyard electronics. None of them can recall anything before “the shutdown” as all robot’s memories were wiped. They encounter PC and give them guidance and information about the tasks ahead.</p>
  

 
<p>Landfill Management</p>

<p>Landfill Management are the non-sentient robots who keep maintenance of the landfill and ensure no sentient robots can leave. They are characterized by their more modern and cleaner look with white panelling that contrasts the landfill. </p>
 
<p>STAN </p>

<p>Stan is an automatic checkout robot from before the war. Stan was one of the first robots made by SuperNet, which was still only a supermarket management company at the time. He is a self-service checkout with an expressive face screen. He asks PC to retrieve him an item to relive “the glory days”, which is what he refers to his self-checkout days as.
