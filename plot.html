    <p>The game opens with a booting screen that is filled with errors and missing data. It stops scrolling showing only the text “Built to scale”. We then cut to a dark workshop with our player character robot [PC] lighting up. In the corner lies a military robot with a hole in its chest. Dim light peers through the workshop door.</p>
    
    <p>PC leaves the workshop venturing through damp caves of compost and mould following light to find their way out. On their way through the junk caves, they encounter claw hands which allow them to grab onto objects and climb. </p>
    
    <p>They reach Lush Scrap Tunnels where they meet a robot scavenging for parts. The scavenger says they’ve only ever seen “Old Treads” leave the Caves, and that they hear he has a workshop there. They go on to say Old Treads was always talking about climbing out of the landfill and call him crazy. Scavenger gives PC magnet hands they found and couldn’t make use of. In the next level they meet Hoover man, the household cleaning robot who tells PC about Junk Town is full of robots who might have answers for them.</p> 
    
    <p>On their way out of the caves, they face off against a Decommissioned Scrapyard Cleanup Bot blocking their way.</p>
    
    <p>On entry to Junk Town, a small town built with old and rusted panels, PC meets a robot who tells about the rebels in Junk town. On progressing further up Junk town PC unlocks a fan hand and meets the rebels. They say they don’t remember who they were before “the shutdown” but think they can get answers if they managed to leave the landfill. They say Old Treads told them he was working on something that would be able to scale the landfill.</p>
    
    <p>PC continues past Junk Town and finds themselves in the Towered Graves where they meet a decommissioned Military bot who tells lore on how robots became sentient and tried to destroy humanity but lost and were thrown into the landfill. PC gets warned about the Non sentient cleanup bots patrolling the Towered Graves.</p>
    
    <p>PC finds new hands here. Further up PC meets Retail bot who has the side quest that will tell the origins of “SuperNet” the origin of robot sentience. </p>
    
    <p>PC encounters many foes he must avoid which are the non-sentient robots, eventually encountering a boss battle with a fully functional scrapyard cleanup bot who towers over the stage. </p>
    
    <p> After defeating the scrapyard cleanup bot, the next level is set in the peaceful forestry on the outskirts of the landfill. It’s in this area that PC finally completes their goal of climbing out and is joined by all the other robots who helped them along the way. </p>
